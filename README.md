Project Abstract

Udio is a textbook trading platform (website) designed for university students. Website releases will be tested by SFU students. 

Sellers can list their used textbooks with pictures and selling price on the website. Buyers can purchase books through the websiteâ€™s listing pages. Listing pages show books in groups which can be filtered by price and conditions. Each book has a historical price chart showing high, low, and mean prices. Users can create profiles and login with Google, Facebook, and other APIs. Transactions are handled with Paypal.
